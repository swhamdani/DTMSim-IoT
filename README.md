# DTMSim-IoT V1.1

DTMSim-IoT is a simulator for Distributed Trust Management Schemes.
Setup (Release/Debug) files are added to run on Windows Operating System. Once the installation is done, simulation tool will be available for testing.

For instance, the following two distributed trust management Schemes are implemented:

1. Dynamic Distributed Trust Management Scheme (Ref: https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/elektrik/issues/elk-21-29-2/elk-29-2-21-2003-5.pdf)
2. Static Distributed Trust Management Scheme (Ref: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1155/2015/859731)

However, the other distributed trust management models can also be implemented on demand. 
My prime objective is to make this simulation tool as an open source test bench for researchers to test their models. If anyone wants to contribute, please let me know.

*Note: In case of any inconvenience, please don't hesitate to contact me.
