# DTMSim-IoT V1.0

**DTMSim-IoT** is a standalone simulator for **Distributed Trust Management Schemes in IoT networks**. Originally developed in C# using Visual Studio 2019 as a Windows application, this tool was designed as part of my Master's thesis and presented at a top IEEE conference held at the **University of Calgary, Canada**, on **August 21, 2020**. The corresponding conference paper is published and has since received wide recognition.

Over the past 5 years, **many PhD and Master's researchers around the globe have contacted me** expressing their interest in this tool and its relevance to their work in trust management for IoT. Numerous research papers have cited my work, and this response has further fueled my commitment to contribute to the research community.

Today, as part of my passion for open-source and knowledge sharing, I am publishing the **complete source code** of DTMSim-IoT on GitHub. I believe this simulator can serve as a valuable **test bench for researchers and students** to model, test, and extend various distributed trust models.
